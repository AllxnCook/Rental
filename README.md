# Rental

Dreaming of driving luxury vehicles doesn't have to be so bad. This app is to give you that dream even if you're living on a budget. Rental gives you the opportunity to rent luxury vehicles by the hour.

# Users

Users can choose from a list of luxury vehicles available for rent. Each vehicle has a price attached to let the user know what pricing they're getting into up front before renting.
Once the user has chosen a vehicle they can see the details for that vehicle such as pickup location, price per hour, year, make, model, and ability to add a payment method.
Price is calculated upon 'Pay Now'.
After the user has completed a rental, then that rental will be within a list of 'My Rentals' with ability to view the details of previous rentals.

# How to User
